WARNING:

Some of the code for H4 outputs a function other than H4; the
same warning of course applies to functions "downstream" from H4.
The errors are marked in the versions with names ending in the word
"comments". 
These errors don't appear to affect the correctness of any statement in my
2021 INTEGERS paper. If a user finds otherwise, please contact me (Barry Brent)

Dot-nb files require Mathematica.
Dot-jpynb files require a Jupyter notebook reader.
Data files are in text format. 
Data files belong to the dot-nb or dot-jpynb files in which they are written or called; should be self-explanatory.
Some data files do not appear in the file list because github thought they were too large.
They are available from me by email, or from ResearchGate, or by whatever other means we can figure out.
